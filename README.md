Ping-Pong

Ping-pong is a classic programming exercise that utilizes branching and looping. Here's how it works:

    A user enters a number and the application returns all numbers from 1 to the user input with the following changes:
        All numbers divisible by 3 are replaced by "ping".
        All numbers divisible by 5 are replaced by "pong"
        All numbers divisible by both 3 and 5 are replaced by "ping-pong".

If the user enters 15, the program will return:

1
2
"ping"
4
"pong"
"ping"
7
8
"ping"
"pong"
11
"ping"
13
14
"ping-pong"

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/pingpong`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.
